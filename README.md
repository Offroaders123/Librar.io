# Librar.io

One of my main goals for starting this project is to have a proper, simple music player for my iTunes Library on Windows. I use Bootcamp on my Mac, and I have it set up so both operating systems can access the library directory from either partition, but the Windows version of iTunes doesn't support the new folder structure that the new "Music" app does with macOS (The one that replaced iTunes in macOS Catalina).

Using the File System Access API, I can essentially just make my own PWA file system directory tree viewer with enhanced music playing capabilities!

Can't wait to see what comes out of this project! I just came up with the current name "Librar.io" today, so that could possibly change, but we'll have to see!

Oh yeah, and in my mind, it's pronounced either "Li-brar-eeoo", like a music library, but with the `.io` naming convention a lot of sites are using, because why not! It's more of a meta-humor reference to that than anything else, haha.
